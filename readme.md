got the suggestion of making a frame size calculator

given focal length, subject size, distance and sensor size the goal is to properly calcualte the percentage a subject will take up of the frame in the final picture

- for example, at 20 feet, using a 400mm lens, what percentage of the frame will a 5" bird take up?
